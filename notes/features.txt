* The architecture of the application should follow "microservice" practices rather than "monolith" ones
    * The reason for this is because the ambition of the developer to implement countless complex features leads to the application being relatively large-scale and complex with diverse functionality and high scalability requirements typically benefit from a microservice approach.
* In regard to organizing and storing the microservice application, the platform should follow a "Monorepo" approach rather than a "Polyrepo" one

* When developing a platform with a microservice architecture, communication occurs with two types of entities: clients and services. The approach to handling communication between client and service should be different from the method between service and other services.
